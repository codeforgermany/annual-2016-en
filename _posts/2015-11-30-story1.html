            <p>The number of people fleeing war and poverty has increased dramatically in the past two years. This presents new challenges to both politics and civil society in Germany and elsewhere.
              A safe arrival and a first orientation are still the most urgent issues. The tech community in Germany has quickly taken to the matter.
              The focus on "Digital Refugee Labs" is an effort to strengthen existing projects, help other NGOs with their digital needs, and provide the necessary infrastructure for civic tech (e.g. open wifi).
